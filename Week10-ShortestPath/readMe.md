# [THE TWO ROUTES - 601A](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/601/A)

INFORMATIONS THAT ARE NEEDED IN THIS PROBLEM : 
- n towns (numbered 1 through n) 
- m bidirectional railways 
- x, y (pair of different town)
- u, v (point u connected to v, which makes a railway)

OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATIONS:
- There is bidirectional road between towns x and y if and only if there is no railway between them 
- Travelling to a different town using one railway or one rod always takes exactly one hour.
- A train and a bus leave town 1 at the same time, both have same destination. 
- Plan out routes for the vehicles which took the minimum number of hours. 
- Output one integer which is the smallest possible time of the later vehicle's arrival in town n
- if it is impossible, output -1.
